This new home for my writing on the web is thanks to the help of the wonderful Tony Pitale. He has helped me shift veronicaerb.com from using plain ol’ HTML and CSS (well, I’d already started using Sass) to ever so clever Jekyll. Jekyll allows me to use some of the power of Ruby (a favorite programming language of these modern times) while still staying happily within coding concepts I already understand.

Thanks for joining me here!
