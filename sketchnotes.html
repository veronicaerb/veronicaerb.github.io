		<h3>Resources</h3>
		<p>If video isn't your thing, or you're looking for more from some other great folks, Veronica highly recommends the resources below.</p>

		<h4>An Article</h4>

		<h4><a href="http://www.core77.com/blog/sketchnotes/sketchnotes_101_the_basics_of_visual_note-taking_19678.asp ">Sketchnotes 101</a> by <a href="http://www.craightonberman.com/">Craighton Berman</a></h4>
		<p>This is the article that held my hand through my first sketchnote experiments. It’s got everything you need if you want to get started quickly without watching a video or reading a book. And, I highly recommend starting quickly—don’t give yourself time to worry about whether you’re doing it “right.”</p>

		<h4>Books</h4>

		<h4><a href="http://amzn.com/0321885112">The Sketchnote Handbook</a> by <a href="http://rohdesign.com/">Mike Rhode</a></h4>
		<p>This fantastic how-to book covers sketchnoting in a beautifully crafted, hand-illustrated book. Though sketching while notetaking has been around for ages, Mike coined the term “sketchnotes” and can be credited with really getting the sketchnote movement going.</p>

		<h4><a href="http://amzn.com/0615591876">The Graphic Facilitator’s Guide</a> by <a href="http://loosetooth.com">Brandy Agerbeck</a></h4>
		<p>Graphic facilitation is the bigger, more interactive cousin of sketchnoting, and there’s lots to learn from this technique. Brandy is an awesome graphic facilitator (and fellow Grinnell College alumna) who makes lots of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/loosetoothdotcom">great videos about her work</a>. If you’re moved enough, you might even use sketchnoting as a way to transition to graphic facilitation rockstar.</p> 

		<h4>Another Video</h4>

		<h4><a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/sunni_brown.html">Doodlers, unite!</a> by <a href="http://sunnibrown.com/">Sunni Brown</a></h4>
		<p>In this TED talk, Sunni argues for the validity of the doodle. The research and stories she tells support sketchnoting just as well as they support the doodle.</p>

		
		<h4>Sketchnotes</h4>
		<p>Gather ideas for sketchnoting by checking out other great sketchnotes. Searching for the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/sketchnotes">sketchnotes tag on Flickr</a> is a good place to start.</p>
