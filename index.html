<blockquote>Hi, I’m Veronica Erb. <br/>I lead research by creating space.</blockquote>

<section class="section">
	<h3>Leadership</h3>
	<p>I believe in <a href="https://medium.com/@verbistheword/apply-for-nprs-ux-research-internship-df9dd74d6d24">an apprenticeship model</a> for <a href="https://npr.design/come-practice-these-four-skills-at-our-ux-research-internship-5bc87c5953f9">teaching research skills</a>. Through a combination of coaching and leading by example, I help UX researchers develop balanced practices that are guided by the principles that unite quality research and are tailored to the practitioner's strengths and interests.</p>

	<h3>Research Expertise</h3>
	<p>After 10 years of conducting research for half a dozen different organizations, I design methodologies that gather actionable findings and recommendations. Project decisions become easier with the context my research provides.</p>

	<h3>Remote Collaboration</h3>
	<p>I have been working remotely since before it was a pandemic-slowing community strategy. My peers chose me for the One NPR Award for spearheading and <a href="https://npr.design/removing-obstacles-from-remote-meetings-an-illustrated-guide-d411007a1fea">nurturing communities of remote workers</a> and of digital women at NPR, and I continue to be sought after for my advice and commiseration.</p>

	<h3>About Veronica Erb</h3>
	<p>Each month, I write <em><a href="https://findingout.substack.com/">Finding Out</a></em>, an email newsletter for people who do and use UX research.</p>

	<p>Previously, I lead UX research at NPR; I co-organized the IA Summit; served as a user experience consultant for Cisco, Marriott, and Yahoo; facilitated UX research in Rwandan teacher training schools; and studied 17th-century Dutch maps at Chicago’s Newberry Library.</p>

	<p>I live in St. Louis, where I delight in gardening and playing ukulele with my family.</p>
