				<h5><a href="https://findingout.substack.com/p/the-gap-between-knowing-and-acting">The Gap between Knowing and Acting</a></h5>
				<p>Even Facebook researchers struggle to be heard when their findings contradict leadership's wishes. A small paragraph in a <em>Wall Street Journal</em> piece brought to mind my own struggles with sharing research findings, and how these struggles originate with our culture.</p>

				<h5><a href="https://findingout.substack.com/p/the-warmth-of-an-open-ended-question">The warmth of an open ended question</a></h5>
