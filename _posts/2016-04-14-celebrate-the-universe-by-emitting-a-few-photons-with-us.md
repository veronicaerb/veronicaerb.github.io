This Saturday, Tony and I are getting married. At the beginning of the ceremony, around 3pm CT, we plan to consciously emit photons.

We discovered the idea of thinking of our photons through a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkzQxw16G9w">video about how big a person can get</a>. The video starts with the physical constraints of the height of a human, but it doesn’t stop there. The beautiful conclusion is that each of us humans emits tiny particles of light, and each of those photons has the potential to travel forever into the universe. And so we are, at least in this way, endless.

As we officially begin to honor our marriage, though we will only be a group of ten humans standing close to one another, know that we’ll be thinking of all our friends and family, including you.

We’d be honored, if you are moved, for you to take a moment on April 16 to think of us, too, and maybe emit some photons.
