10 years ago, my mother gave me a copy of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0763619612/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0763619612&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=veronicaerb-20&amp;linkId=6METIS54TWO6BWT7">The Dot by Peter H. Reynolds</a>. Now, it's the inspiration for <a href="http://www.thedotclub.org/dotday/">International Dot Day</a>.

I like the book and the celebration so much that I decided to <a href="https://vimeo.com/106228585">read The Dot aloud</a>, in case you don't have a copy handy.

Once you do fall in love with Vashti and her dots, I highly recommend getting a copy and getting everyone you knowÂ to read it.

Now, go make your mark!
