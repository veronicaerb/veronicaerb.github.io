		<h3>Roles</h3>
		<h4>NPR</h4>
		<p>At <a href="http://nprdesigngroup.tumblr.com/">NPR Digitial Media Design</a>, I lead  research and contribute design to digital environments on national platforms. Since joining the team in November 2014, I have designed systems that smooth the user journey between national platforms, researched how NPR One listeners choose to donate to stations, and created book guides for the <i>Morning Edition</i> book club:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Book guide for <i><a href="http://www.npr.org/assets/artslife/books/2015/05/atkinsonbookguide.pdf">A God in Ruins</a>: A Novel</i></li>
			<li>Book guide for <i><a href="http://www.npr.org/2014/12/11/369409338/join-the-morning-edition-book-club-were-reading-deep-down-dark">Deep Down Dark:</a> The Untold Stories of 33 Men Buried in a Chilean Mine, and the Miracle That Set Them Free</i>.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>The guides are companions to the first two installations of <a href="http://www.npr.org/series/402558323/the-morning-edition-book-club">the <i>Morning Edition</i> book club</a>.</p>
		<h4>IA Summit</h4>
		<p>From 2014-2015, I was one of three co-chairs for the <a href="http://2015.iasummit.org">IA Summit</a>, held in Minneapolis, Minnesota, April 23-27. You can get a peek of this community-organized conference through the <a href="http://verbistheword.wordpress.com/tag/ias15/">IA Summit behind the scenes</a> posts on my blog.</p>
		<h4>EightShapes</h4>
		<p>From 2011-2014, I planned and moderated UX research, prototyped new designs, and contributed to information architecture strategies at DC UX agency <a href="http://www.eightshapes.com/">EightShapes</a>.</p>
		<h4>FHI 360</h4>
		<p>From 2008-2011, I made websites and advocated for users at a non-profit now a part of <a href="http://www.fhi.org/en/index.htm">FHI 360</a>. Through usability testing and non-leading interviews, I learned ways to make the <a href="http://www.educationcommons.rw/">Rwanda Education Commons</a> helpful for users in teacher training schools. I served as RECâ€™s front-end developer and prototyper, and contributed to its user interface design. Work included:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="folio/wireframes.html">Wireframes</a> from sketches to interactive prototypes,</li>
			<li><a href="folio/diagrams.html">Diagrams</a> other than wireframes, and</li>
			<li><a href="folio/research.html">Research</a>, such as usability testing, card sorting, and more.</li>
		</ul>
